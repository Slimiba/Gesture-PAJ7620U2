# Gesture-PAJ7620U2
 
The PAJ7620U2 integrates gesture recognition function with general I2C interface into a single chip forming an image analytic sensor system. It can recognize 9 human hand gesticulations such as moving up, down, left, right, forward, backward, circle-clockwise, circle-counter Key Parameters clockwise, and waving. It also offers built-in proximity detection in sensing approaching or departing object from the sensor. The PAJ7620 is packaged into module form in-built with IR LED and optics lens as a complete sensor solution.

1. This library is built for PAJ7620 gesture sensor for STM32 using STM32cube IDE, using only basic 8 gestures either in "normal" or "gaming" mode;
2. Library isn't seperatly built, this icludes entire project (both library and main code), but feel free to change main.cpp in your own projects.

This project is yet to be finished so any help is appreciated and welcomed.

This project is developed by Markuss Johansons.
